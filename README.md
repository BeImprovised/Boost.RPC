Boost.RPC - Remote Procedure Call library
---------------------------------------

The goal of this library is to enable seamless remote procedure
calls between C++ objects in different processes and machines.

The Boost RPC library will leverage Boost.TypeErasure to abstract
the difference between classes on remote machines and local machines.

The library will aim to support any number of different RPC protocols 
and will provide built-in support for Google Protocol Buffers and
JSON RPC.


### Notice ###

    This library is not part of the official Boost C++ library, but
    is written, to the best of my ability, to follow the best practices
    established by the Boost community and with the hope of being 
    considered for inclusion with a future Boost release.
